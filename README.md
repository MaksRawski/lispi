# LISP interpreter 
Implementation of lisp interpreter according to 
[the original paper from 1960](https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf)
and partly
[the programmer's manual from 1985](https://www.lispmachine.net/books/LISP_1.5_Programmers_Manual.pdf). 

## Usage
The interpreter is pretty much done but needs more testing so once that's done there may be a REPL! 
So for now you can run `cargo test` and see all those green ok's!

## LICENSE
Obviously MIT. Available in the `LICENSE` file.
