# LISP interpreter 
![coverage](https://gitlab.com/MaksRawski/lisp-interpreter/badges/main/coverage.svg)

Implementation of lisp interpreter according to 
[the original paper from 1960](https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf)
and partly
[the programmer's manual from 1985](https://www.lispmachine.net/books/LISP_1.5_Programmers_Manual.pdf). 

## Usage
The interpreter and parser are done but I haven't yet got them to work together.
So for now you can run `cargo test` to run all unit tests and see all those green ok's!

## LICENSE
Obviously MIT. Available in the `LICENSE` file.
