# LISP parser
Implementation of a LISP parser according to the 
[original paper from 1960](https://web.archive.org/web/20230614192923/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf).


## Usage
Only pages 8-14 have been implemented so far and until `src/main.rs` is created 
this project provides no direct utility.
