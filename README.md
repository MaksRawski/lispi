# LISP I interpreter 
![coverage](https://gitlab.com/MaksRawski/lisp-interpreter/badges/main/coverage.svg)

Welcome to LISP I, the world's most beautiful programming language.
First discovered by Paul McCarthy in 1960 and described in the paper 
["Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine"](https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf).
Two years later explained in further detail in the 
[LISP I Programmer's Manual](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/rle_lisp/LISP_I_Programmers_Manual_Mar60.pdf).

This project is an interpreter for the language and I'm on a quest to implement every function described in the manual
(there is 90 of them listed in the "Alphabetic Index to Functions" on the page 147 of the manual).

## Usage
NOTE: this project is FAR from being finished. Right now only a basic REPL with elementary functions is available.
After installing from crates.io with `cargo install lispi`, you can get access to the REPL by just running `lispi`.

## LICENSE
Obviously MIT. Available in the `LICENSE` file.
